# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Android app (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, CameraX, OpenCV) that scans Magic: The Gathering cards
dropped into a box: the camera finds each card by its outline or a fixed area and captures it
once it is still. What happens next depends on the mode (Settings → *Send cards to a scanner
server*):

- **Standalone**: a vision AI (Gemini / OpenAI / Anthropic / OpenRouter / local Ollama) reads
  name, collector number, set code and the ★/• foil marker, the printing is matched (offline
  card data or the Scryfall API) and the card goes into the phone's inventory - or, if
  uncertain, into its review queue.
- **Client mode**: the capture is uploaded to a scanner server, which reads it, matches it and
  keeps the collection; the phone shows the server's answer. The phone's own inventory, review
  queue and AI settings are not used.

Either way a capture is saved on the phone first (the outbox) and waits for the network if
there is none. Magic only.

The Python side is the scanner server, repository
[filipesibinel/scanner-server](https://github.com/filipesibinel/scanner-server), checked out
beside this one (`../scanner-server`): the detection, auto-capture, prompts / answer parsing,
matching and CSV format here are ports of its code, and it is the server of client mode.
**README.md maps each Kotlin file to the Python code it ports** - when changing any of those,
or the station upload and its answer, check the Python side and keep both in step (the
thresholds were measured there; see its PROGRAM_DOCUMENTATION.md).

The desktop scanner the port started from ([filipesibinel/scanner](https://github.com/filipesibinel/scanner),
`../scanner`) is a separate project with the same detection code; it is not changed from here.

## Common Commands

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/android-studio/jbr     # Android Studio's JDK (Java 25); there is no system java
./gradlew assembleDebug                      # app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk (~110 MB: OpenCV)
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest                  # JVM tests (parity with the Python code, the server's answers)
~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb logcat -s Scanner:I     # captures, identifications, the server's answers, review queue
```

Toolchain: AGP 9.4 (built-in Kotlin, no `kotlin-android` plugin), Kotlin 2.4, Gradle 9.8 wrapper,
compileSdk 37.2 (`release(37) { minorApiLevel = 2 }` - current AndroidX / OkHttp require 37),
minSdk 26, ABIs arm64-v8a + x86_64. `local.properties` (sdk.dir) is not in git. Don't add
`jvmToolchain(17)`: it would try to download a JDK 17.

## Testing

- **Unit tests** (`app/src/test`): answer parser and name similarity (`ParserParityTest`), CSV
  export byte-identical to the server's `write_collection_csv` (`ExportParityTest`), CSV import
  (`ImportTest`), the server's answers in client mode (`ServerOutcomeTest`). Reference JSON files
  are made by the `*_reference.py` scripts in `app/src/test/resources`, run from
  `../scanner-server` with its venv (`parser_reference.py` prints its JSON, `export_reference.py`
  writes the file named on its command line).
- **Instrumented tests** (`app/src/androidTest`): run them with `adb shell am instrument -w -e class
  com.cardscanner.<Test> com.cardscanner.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner` after
  installing both APKs (`assembleDebug assembleDebugAndroidTest`) - **not** `connectedDebugAndroidTest`,
  which uninstalls the app afterwards and wipes its data (and the files the tests write). Results
  go to `/sdcard/Android/data/com.cardscanner/files/`. `OutlineParityTest` takes recorded frames
  as assets (`-PdebugFrames=<dir with frames/>`), `PipelineTest` a local AI (`-e aiUrl -e aiModel`),
  `OfflineFindTest` downloaded card data + internet. Details in README.md.
- **Real device**: the user's Pixel 10 is mounted over the scanning box (USB debugging). Check
  changes there with `adb install -r` (keeps the app's data), `adb exec-out screencap -p` and
  `adb shell input tap` (screen 1080x2424). **A capture on it is real**: in client mode it goes
  to the user's server and into their scanned cards; standalone it goes into the phone's own
  inventory. Check the mode first (`run-as com.cardscanner cat shared_prefs/settings.xml`), ask
  before capturing there, and never import test CSVs or clear its inventory.
- **Emulator** (`Pixel_Phone`): fine for UI and flows, not for reading quality - its camera is
  too low for collector numbers, and with `-camera-back emulated` it shows no card at all (use
  a fixed area to capture anyway; such captures end in the review queue). For client mode
  point it at a **test server** - a second server container with its own data folder and port -
  not at the user's real one. `adb shell cmd connectivity airplane-mode enable` / `disable`
  tests the outbox. Settings can be prepared by writing `shared_prefs/settings.xml` through
  `run-as` (put the original back afterwards).

## Where Things Live

| Area | Code |
|---|---|
| Card outline, warp (port of `object_detector.py`) | `detection/CardOutline.kt`: `findCardOutline`, `warpCard` |
| Stillness, auto-capture, new card, fixed area (port of `scanner.py`) | `detection/CardTracker.kt`: `process`, `processArea`, `isCardSettled`, `newCardArrived` |
| Camera frames, taking a capture | `ScannerViewModel.kt`: `analyze`, `manualCapture`, `capture`, `cutOutCard`; `ui/ScannerScreen.kt`: `CameraPreview` |
| A capture's way: saved, processed in the current mode, retried without a network, resumed after a restart | `Outbox.kt`; `ScannerViewModel.kt`: `identify`, `showScan`, `process` (the retry loop), `isOffline`, the `init` block that resumes the outbox |
| Client mode: the scanner server does the rest | `server/ScannerServer.kt` (`sendCapture`, `outcome`, `undo`, `test`, `ServerOutcome.parse`); `ScannerViewModel.kt`: `sendOnce`, `serverAnswered`, `undoOnServer`, `serverPageUrl`; `ui/ScannerScreen.kt`: `ServerScanRow`; `ui/SettingsScreen.kt`: `ServerSection`; the server side is `app.py: station_capture` in `../scanner-server` |
| Standalone: AI, printing match, add or review | `ScannerViewModel.kt`: `identifyOnce`, `finish`, `queueForReview`, `addScan`, `undoScan` |
| AI providers, answer parser, foil check, token use | `ai/CardIdentifier.kt`; prompts (= `prompts.py` BUILT_IN mtg) in `ai/Prompts.kt` |
| Printing match (`search_card_exact` steps, `match` tags, `CONFIRMED`) | `scryfall/Scryfall.kt` (offline first, then the API) |
| Offline card data (Scryfall default cards → SQLite) | `scryfall/CardDatabase.kt`; `ScannerViewModel.kt`: `downloadCardData` |
| Inventory (SQLite, the server's table + merge key), exports, import | `inventory/Inventory.kt`, `inventory/Export.kt`, `inventory/Import.kt`; `ScannerViewModel.kt`: `importCsv`, `export` |
| Review queue (photo + reading + suggestion) | `inventory/ReviewQueue.kt`, `ui/ReviewScreen.kt`, printing search `ui/PrintingSearch.kt` |
| Screens | `ui/ScannerScreen.kt` (camera, overlay, area drawing with loupe, scan list), `ui/InventoryScreen.kt`, `ui/SettingsScreen.kt`; navigation in `MainActivity.kt` |
| Settings (SharedPreferences, saved on every change) | `AppSettings.kt` (`serverMode`, `serverUrl`, `stationId`, ...) |
| Sound effects (the web UI's beeps) | `Sounds.kt` |

## Conventions and Pitfalls

- **Two modes, one capture path.** Everything up to the cut-out card is shared; `process`
  decides per attempt which mode handles it. Code for one mode must not touch the other's data:
  client mode never writes the phone's inventory or review queue.
- **A capture is settled or it is in the outbox.** `process` removes it only when `sendOnce` /
  `identifyOnce` return true; returning false means "nothing happened, try again" - so return
  false only for a missing connection (`IOException` in client mode, `isOffline` standalone),
  never after the card was added or queued. Don't keep bitmaps in memory while waiting: they
  are reloaded from the outbox per attempt (a long offline pile would run out of memory).
- **The server's answer**: `ServerOutcome.parse` must follow `station_capture`'s JSON
  (`ServerOutcomeTest` has real answers). The upload carries the outbox id as `capture_id`, so
  a repeat is one card - keep it. The server keeps one Undo per station: only the newest added
  card can be taken back.
- **The CSV export is the server's collection CSV**, byte for byte (`ExportParityTest`). When
  its columns change there, regenerate `export_reference.json` and change `writeCsv`.
- **Match confidence** (standalone): only `Scryfall.CONFIRMED` matches (`set_number`,
  `name_number`, `name_set_digit` - same as the Python `CONFIRMED_MATCHES`) are added
  automatically; everything else goes to the review queue while `autoAdd` is on. Keep new lookup
  paths tagged.
- **Frames**: analysis frames are ~1280x960 (4:3), turned upright plus the user's extra rotation;
  stills are ~3264x2448 in the same 4:3 view, so outlines / areas only need scaling and the still
  is searched again for the exact edges (`cutOutCard`). In fixed-area mode the photo is the area.
- **Fixed area** assumes the phone doesn't move (it compares a fixed spot of the image).
- **Preview rotation** needs `PreviewView.ImplementationMode.COMPATIBLE` (TextureView); a
  SurfaceView ignores view rotation.
- **Property order in `ScannerViewModel`**: `init` blocks run in file order - one that uses a
  property declared further down sees `null`. The outbox is resumed from an `init` placed after
  the properties it needs.
- **Keyed LazyColumns** keep the previously first item in view when items are inserted above it
  or the order changes - new items end up hidden above. Scroll to the top on new scans / sort /
  filter changes (see `ScannerScreen`, `InventoryScreen`).
- **SQLite on minSdk 26 is 3.18**: no `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` (upsert by hand in a transaction);
  bind mixed-type arguments as `arrayOf<Any?>(...)`.
- **Plain HTTP is allowed** (`network_security_config.xml`): the scanner server and a local
  Ollama have no HTTPS on a home network.
- **Scryfall** requires a User-Agent and Accept header - also for card images: the Coil image
  loader in `MainActivity` sets `Scryfall.USER_AGENT` (OkHttp's default gets HTTP 400). Keep
  50-100 ms between bulk API requests.
- **AI costs**: Gemini Flash thinks by default (~90% of its output tokens); Flash-Lite is the
  default (same reads on a 10-card test, ~$0.79 per 1000 cards). OpenRouter's `:free` vision
  models were rate-limited upstream when tested (2026-09-26) - not dependable. Ollama requests
  send `think: false` and `keep_alive`.
- **Never show or log API keys or the station token** (Settings masks them; read them only
  into shell variables).
- **UI texts are in English**; the user talks in Portuguese.
- Commit and push only when the user asks.
